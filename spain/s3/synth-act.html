			<h3 style="text-align: center;">Synthesis Activity 1:</h3>
			<ol>
  <li>1938 - Labour Charter: This resulted in a new trend in which Spain’s economy underwent various improvements.</li>
  <li>Reforms of the Second Republic: These caused there to be a ban on civil marriage and divorce, trade unions, political parties except Nationalism, and the Basque and Catalan languages.</li>
  <li>Lack of totalitarianism: This would have helped to maintain the economy, politics, and the military.</li>
  <li>Spain reverted to having close relations to European countries: This occurred as a result of a trade agreement in 1970.</li>
  <li>US investment in Spain - the US investment in Spain had a decent impact as it lead to trade between Spain, quickly improving their economy and led to better foreign relations with European countries.</li>
  <li>1975 - Franco’s son, Juan Carlo, inherited the crown: this had a positive effect on the community having hoping for a new Spain.</li>
  <li>1965 - censorship and oppression ended: this was a gradual change so there was no major impact when it was fulled ended</li>
  <li>1942 - Law of the Cortes: this event did not change much at all except showed more power to Franco’s supporters</li>
</ol>
			<h3 style="text-align: center;">S3 Synthesis Activity 2: Assess the social and economic effects of the Spanish Civil War.</h3>
<p>Thesis: Although there was a significant depletion of resources, the social impacts were more significant than economic changes in the post-war era from 1939 to 1969, seen by the worsening relations between the government and the church, the increase in European and other international relations, and the stagnated economy in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Assertion 1: To begin, although the US supported many of Spain’s post-war changes, internal social changes had affected Spain to a great extent which can be seen by the worsening conditions between the government and the church.</p>
<p>Assertion 2: In addition to the social issues and despite Britain’s conflict with Spain, Spain’s increasing European relations, seen by the agreements made with the NATO, shows the external effects of the Spanish Civil War.</p>
<p>Assertion 3: Similar to the increasing European relations, Spain’s economy stagnated in the 1960s despite the depletion of resources as a consequence of the Spanish Civil War.</p>
