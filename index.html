	<p>Weimar Golden Years - The years 1924-29 are often described as the ‘Golden Age of 
Weimar’ because of their stability, economic and improved living standards. The beginning of 
1923 when Gustav Stresemann was elevated to the chancellorship began the Golden Years. Stresemann and his ministers formulated plans to reduce the hyperinflation crisis by introducing a new currency, the Rentenmark, and fixed its value to gold prices. The government announced its determination to meet reparations payments and sought international assistance to do so. The US-led Dawes Plan was finalised in April 1924 and implemented four months later. 
Gustav Stresemann - Gustav Ernst Stresemann; 10 May 1878 – 3 October 1929) was a 
German statesman who served as Chancellor in 1923 (for a brief period of 102 days) and Foreign Minister 1923–1929, during the Weimar Republic. He was co-laureate of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1926. His most notable achievement was reconciliation between Germany and France, for which he and Aristide Briand received the Nobel Peace Prize. During a period of political instability and fragile, short-lived governments, he was generally seen as the most influential cabinet member in most of the Weimar Republic's existence. 
Kurt von Schleicher - He was a german general and last chancellor during the Weimar 
Republic. The significance of this general’s power is he was a rival for power of Adolf Hitler; however, exposed Hitler's limits when he was murdered in 1934 by Hitler’s SS. Kurt von Schleicher has caused Hitler to become more aggressive during his rise to power.
Proportional representation - Mixed Member Proportional Representation is a mix of 
Westminster’s First Past the Post electoral system and Party Lists. Members of the Bundestag are elected every four years by all German citizens over the age of 18. This is significant under the specific voting conditions as Hitler was gaining power during the time.
Emergence/Rise - Emergence is defined as coming into view to others after being
 exposed. In terms of the given unit, Hitler rose/emerged when joining a political party in September of 1919, the NSDAP. He rose to become the leader of the party by threatening to not return unless made the leader. Through the 1920’s and 1930’s, he rose in power, becoming the leader of the largest political party, which was comprised of Nazis. This caused the authoritarian state that Hitler created.
Treaty of Versailles - War treaty established between Germany and the Allied powers ending World War I. It was signed on June 28, 1919. Germany’s aggravation towards the harsh terms such as decreased land size, smaller forces, and a large sum of debt contributed to the start of World War II. The terms of the treaty were that Germany would pay 132 billion marks, disarmament of existing armies, and giving its land gained in war to other countries.
